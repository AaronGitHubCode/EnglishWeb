        <p>
            Congratulations you have successfully passed our selection program and officially became an employee of the Company™.<br>
            <br>
            Your role here at the Company™ is highly crucial (Not really), we will send you in a metal shoebox that we call Autonomous™ SpaceCraft™ and
            Employee™ <del>Coffin™</del> Habitat™ into desolated planets infested with highly unpredictable and hostile creatures where you will have to
            collect <del>pieces of junk</del> valuable items and return them to the Company™ Building™ to meet your quota every 3 days. <del>so we don't dump you in space</del><br>
            <br>
            You are probably asking yourself <q>oK... buT hOw dO i do ThAt?</q> or <q>whAt iS a vAluaBLe iTem</q>, but don't worry this guide will cover 
            <i>almost</i> everything that you need to <del>barely</del> survive.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Making Profit</h2>
        <img src="https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2273816816184064458/D0236D4B86449BF140404871024BAF0E77E32FE1/?imw=5000&imh=5000&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=false">
        <p>
            Your main and only objective is to find anything that shines, does a funny noise or glows with a suspiciously green light, in summary anything that 
            a baby would try to eat. Each of those pieces have a value but you won't know how much because Jeb is the one who decides the pricing, on top of
            that you have to bring Jeb enough <i>valuable</i> items to fullfil your Exponentially™ Increased™ Three™ Day™ Quota™ or else we will have to <del>open the metal shoebox while in orbit</del> fire you.<br>
            <br>
            The best part of this process is that you can keep ALL of the profit to buy some Rusty™ Tools™ That™ We™ Found™ In™ An™ Old™ Janitor™ Closet™ Used™ For™ Self™ Preservation™ in order
            to help you in the task of finding even more <del>trash</del> <i>valuable</i> items.
        </p>

        <h2>The Creatures</h2>
        <img src="https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2238913464888120934/F0B5F7D3A7F90FEA8094650C3FD5D4A996868031/?imw=5000&imh=5000&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=false">
        <p>
            Although this is the dream job of many kids it isn't as easy as it looks beacuse God had no hand in the creation of the atrocities that you will face everytime you land on planet,
            but don't worry you will be fine as you have no other choice.<br>
            Here is a list of some of those things that you will want to keep an eye on:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Hoarding Bugs A.K.A Fried Chicken</h3>
                    <img src="https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2316601012664948488/4EC87347DF0AA470F073470ADEA08D23DF3371AC/?imw=5000&imh=5000&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=false">
                    <p>
                        One of the most common creatures that you will encounter their behaviour tends to be passive until you provoke them or steal the <i>valuable</i> items they keep in their
                        nest furthermore make sure to not drop any tool or <i>valuable</i> item near them beacuse they will add it to their collection and it will be a pain to steal it from them.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Hygrodere A.K.A The blob</h3>
                    <img src="https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/lethal-company/d/d9/Lethal-company-blob.jpg?width=640">
                    <p>
                        This is probably what a baby that has eaten some <i>valuable</i> items would vomit and as expected is alive. It will try to eat and dissolve anything made of organic matter
                        to grow even fatter <del>like your mom</del> probably with unsucess beacuse it moves at the same pace as an octogenarian snail, just jump over you will be fine.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Forest Keeper A.K.A Selfie Giant</h3>
                    <img src="https://static0.gamerantimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/forest-keeper-lethal-company-2.jpg">
                    <p>
                        Nothing is more terrifying than hearing load steps in the distance, except hearing them getting closer. This massive pile of meat and teeth can and will eat you whole
                        even without chewing, they won't sneak on you that's for sure but they seem to be attracted by the spaceship lights so you better check if there is one waiting for you at
                        night.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Bracken A.K.A AAAHH RUUUUN!!!!</h3>
                    <img src="https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2253550163930785231/DF20FCB01C11FC4D03C58BA1C57E8D6A3F2B3D92/?imw=5000&imh=5000&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=false">
                    <p>
                        If you ever find one of these just run, no second thoughts, no hesitation, just run for your life. You can't run faster than it, you can't outsmart it, you can't fight him back and it has a bigger dick than you.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
